# Img-Proccesing-GUI
Allows the user to use select images and mess around with functions that change pixel values in them, such as making sepia tone and using edge detection.

Current working version: 1.3.2

Patch Notes: Fixed sepia tone function, fine tuned edge detection.

Errors: Selecting an image gives a warning in the python shell, using image "edu45.gif" gives an error, dark and light images don't work well with the edge detection, crop randomly crops part of the image and doesn't really do anything.

Requirements: tkinter, PIL
